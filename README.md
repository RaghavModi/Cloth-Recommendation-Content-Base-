# Cloth-Recommendation-using-seson-and-style

Over here gender.ipynb, season.ipynb, initial_file.ipynb and usage.ipynb contain all the model developed. initial_file.ipynb also contains the code used to edit the original csv file and create a new csv file which is final.csv.

All the other csv file contain the feature extracted from all the .ipynb files. For example from gender.ipynb I have created 2 file feauture_engg_data_gender.csv which is training file and another file is feauture_test_gender.csv which is the test file and similarly for all the other .ipynb files.

I have used all this files in KNN_predict.ipynb to recommend similar products.
